	The 2016 fall GLM was an eventful one that no one in attendance will forget. After the long series of debates 
	and votes on bylaw amendments many people were left wondering "What actually changed?" <br>
	For those wondering, two big things happened:<br>
	1) New lodge flaps are now approved by the LEC (previously approved by GLM). However, the standard flap cannot be changed.<br>
	2) Any flaps issued during your time as a member of the lodge are permitted for uniform wear.
	<br><br>
	To clear up the second big change here are some examples:<br>
	-All members are permitted to wear the standard issue white and red flap<br>
	-Anniversary flaps are issued until the calendar year of the flap. A member who joined in March 2013 
	cannot wear the 2012 anniversary flap.<br>
	-A member who joined in 2013 and paid dues in 2015 may wear the 2015 NOAC sets as they were issued during 
	while that member was dues paid.<br>
	-An Arrowman inducted in 2015 may wear the city skyline flap as it was under a "rolling issue" when they 
	were inducted. That Arrowman mat not wear the sunset flap as that flap's issue ended before that Arrowman's induction.
	<br><br>
	The term "Rolling Issue" is used for any flap that had no event or anniversary affiliation and has yet to 
	be removed from the trading post. Once the stock of a patch is removed from the trading post and can only 
	be purchased from the lodge as part of an auction or is sold out for the final time its issue is ceased.
	<br><br>
	Though members may be eligible to wear certain flaps, they should use their best judgement as to what would 
	be the most appropriate display of their scouting participation before changing flaps.
	<br><br>
	For further clarification on these amendments please contact your chapter leadership.
