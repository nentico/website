	Brothers, we recently had our Spring Fellowship from April 8th to 10th. We had well over one hundred 
brothers in attendance. This Fellowship initiated the competitions of the color war, of which Blue Team 
is currently in the lead. There were many events involved at the fellowship. The teams played lodge ball, 
volleyball and musical jeopardy. We also held a bonnet making class, among other stations. Though the 
weather made it seem more like a winter fellowship, everyone still had a good time. Friday evening, 
we held a wonderful campfire with outstanding campfire songs, skits, and cheers from each of the color 
war teams. At the finale of the campfire, a Vigil call out also occurred with many members advancing to 
the honor. How how! In addition, the food was exceptional as usual, and cheered us up in the midst of a 
bit of cold and rain. To conclude the weekend, we had a General Lodge Meeting, at which past events were 
reflected upon and future plans were unveiled. All things considered, it was a great time! We hope to see 
you at future events!

	Service has been strong in Nentico Lodge this year. This year's Lodge Service day was held on March 
5th at Camp Saffran. Groups helped to clear the roofs on the family cabins, dig out pipes in need of repair, 
and move the front gate. We had a great turnout for service day this year with over 60 brothers in attendance. 
Since the lodge service day in March both Dulaney and Carroll chapters have held service days of their own 
benefitting the community. Dulaney Chapter helped at Lake Roland Park by removing invasive species from the area. 
Carroll chapter opened their service day to the lodge where they assisted in trail maintenance and conducted a 
brotherhood ceremony. Looking forward, there are plans for another lodge service day at the Shapiro Scout Service 
center sometime around the lodge picnic in July.  In August, we will once again be having the OA Expo at the 
Carrie Murray Nature Center. More info on these events to come.

	It was an energetic Saturday on the 28th of January. Scouts could be seen rushing to get inside Carroll 
	Community College for #LEAD as they arrived bright and early that morning. #LEAD had a remarkable attendance 
	of 143 brothers from sections NE-6A and NE-6B. Classes were well received with quality content and great 
	trainers from around the North East and Southern regions; this was not a day of classes to sleep through! 
	Everyone learned something they could take away from the classes including the North East Region Chief who 
	was also in attendance. #LEAD would like to give a massive thanks to its staff and instructors for helping 
	train the leaders of tomorrow. Be sure to check it out next time #LEAD comes around!

	Greetings brothers, an event is coming to Camp Saffran this year and that event is Conclave 2017. 
	The theme this year shall be “Superheroes: Serving the Higher Vision”. Come for games and food, try 
	your best in volleyball or lodgeball. This year will also include a special costume contest to go along 
	with the theme so it’s time to put out your Batman masks and become a hero. Registration is currently 
	open for Conclave, sign up now and take a look at the amazing trading post items we have for sale, 
	including a specially designed cape. Our lodge is the host lodge for Conclave, which means that we 
	should be trying our hardest to win in every event. This also means there will be plenty of staff opportunities available 
	for any arrow men who would like to staff. Anyone you see with a superhero shoulder loop has committed 
	to be staff for Conclave and, you should too. If interested email conclave@nentico.org or seek out Ethan 
	Kincaid or Ben Nelson, we are the coordinators for the event. 
	<br><br>
	As always brothers stay safe and continue to do a good turn daily, I look forward to seeing all of you at Conclave.
